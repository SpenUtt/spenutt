### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub. It ain't much but it's honest...ly fun work. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a shiny new portfolio page...but buried myself under too many `<div>s` and can't find my way back out. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about React. A full-stack Mushroom Picking app is already getting put together with some hooks, duct tape and bubble gum.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything edtech, and on the job hunt as well!
